# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Why

I created this Resume app to give all potential employers access to up-to-date projects that most accurately display my skill level.

## Getting Started

- run 'npm install'

once all dependencies are installed, next

- run 'npm start'

npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
