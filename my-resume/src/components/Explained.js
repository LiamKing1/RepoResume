        This portfolio app is not created to represents the projects I've
        completed, but to showcase my commitment to evolving as a developer and
        pushing my boundaries in every developmental stage of creating this app.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I encourage you to explore my most recent contributions via my
        GitHub account, which highlight my ongoing journey of learning and
        mastering new skills.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The current appearance of this app may drastically change in just a
        week's time as I implement new features and refine my code to align
        closely with industry best practices.

        please don't hesitate to email me using the contact details provided in
        my resume that led you here.
